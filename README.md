Tournament-app "Lan Buddies" made as University project - "Project in Software Engineering 15 â€” VT2025" as part of my Bachelors in Computer & Systems sciences at Stockholm University.
Groupproject with 11 members developing using agile methodology - scrum.

My roles were project leader, scrum master and part of the development team.
Project leader:
Planned and structured the group into teams and set up meetings. Drove engagement and collaboration for all members, and had to drive exclusion of 3 members towards course adminsitrators.

Scrum master: Held "daily" scrums on mondays, wednesdays and fridays. My work involved structuring scrum meetings and sprints to sustain plans towards development goals, and enabled everyone to get their voice heard.

Development team: 
Responsiblity driven Design - laying the foundation for majority of classes in the backend, their responsobilities and dependencies.
Writing code for majority of the backend, particurarly Tournament class where I wrote an algorithm for bracket generation (single- elimination as a binary tree).

Stack:
Backend - java with JPA to handle mariaDB database. Git with Jenkins as CI / CD tool and buildtool. Frontend made in dart that communicates with backend with REST/json API.
